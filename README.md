Samples of recordings and code for data analysis - glider's 0g flight capabilities

1-Analysis of trajectory and acceleration

The file "example_data_aircraft.csv" contains recordings obtained during an aircraft flight. It includes time, GPS position, velocities, and accelerations. The file main.py plots the trajectory of the aircraft, its altitude compared with acceleration, and the proper accelerations on each axis.

2-Analysis of jitter

The files "example_jitter_glider.csv" and "example_jitter_aircraft.csv" contain samples of data recorded during cruise conditions. Running the file jitter_analysis_main.py allows to study the jitter and level of vibration for these files.
